SPREADSHEET MASTERY - TEACHER INSTRUCTIONS
==========================================

This data file contains practice exercises aligned with the "Spreadsheet Mastery" presentation.

DATA SECTIONS:
--------------

SHEET 1: CLASS PARTY CONTRIBUTIONS
- Students can practice: Absolute cell references ($), multiplication formulas
- Exercise: Calculate Amount column using =Family_Members * $Contribution_Per_Student
- Formula should be: =B2*$B$12 (with absolute reference to contribution amount)

SHEET 2: PARTY SUPPLIES  
- Students can practice: Basic formulas, relative references, SUM, copy-paste formulas
- Exercise: Calculate Total_Cost using =Quantity * Unit_Price (e.g., =B2*C2)
- Then drag formula down to calculate all totals
- Calculate grand total using =SUM(D2:D10)

SHEET 3: FOOD CHOICES LOOKUP
- Students can practice: VLOOKUP function
- Exercise: Use VLOOKUP to pull food choices into main student list
- Formula example: =VLOOKUP(A4,FoodChoices!A:B,2,FALSE)

SHEET 4: ATTENDEE INFO
- Students can practice: Text functions (LEFT, SEARCH, MID)
- Exercise: Split names from dietary requirements
- Name formula: =LEFT(A2,SEARCH("(",A2)-2)
- Diet formula: =MID(A2,SEARCH("(",A2)+1,SEARCH(")",A2)-SEARCH("(",A2)-1)

SHEET 5: ADDITIONAL FAMILY MEMBERS
- Students can practice: COUNTIF function
- Exercise: Count how many families have more than 3 members
- Formula: =COUNTIF(A2:A10,">3")

ADVANCED EXERCISES:
------------------
1. Conditional Formatting: Highlight supplies costing more than $20
2. Goal Seek: Determine contribution amount needed to reach specific total
3. Data Validation: Create dropdown lists for food choices
4. Charts: Create bar chart showing supply costs

LEARNING OBJECTIVES MET:
-----------------------
✓ Cell references (relative and absolute)
✓ Basic formulas (addition, multiplication)
✓ Functions (SUM, AVERAGE, MAX, MIN, COUNTIF)
✓ VLOOKUP for data retrieval
✓ Text functions (LEFT, MID, SEARCH)
✓ Conditional formatting
✓ Goal Seek
✓ Formula copying/dragging

TIPS FOR STUDENTS:
-----------------
1. Remember: Text positions start at 1 in spreadsheets (not 0 like Python)
2. Use F4 key to toggle between reference types ($A$1, $A1, A$1, A1)
3. Press F2 to edit a cell formula
4. Drag the fill handle (small square at cell corner) to copy formulas

SOLUTION EXAMPLES:
-----------------
If students get stuck, here are some answer formulas:

Contributions Amount: =B2*$B$12
Party Supplies Total: =B2*C2
Sum of all supplies: =SUM(D2:D10)
Name extraction: =LEFT(A2,SEARCH("(",A2)-2)
Count families >3: =COUNTIF(B2:B10,">3")
